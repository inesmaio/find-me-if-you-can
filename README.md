# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project was built as part as a recruitment process.

# Steps to run the APP

In order to run properly the app please follow the following steps:

### `npm install`

Run `npm install` on your console to install all the dependencies

### `create .env file`

To set up your access to [mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/) click on [mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) to create your API access token. Or to other tiles service of your choice.
Once you have the public key, please add to the .env.example file and replace `YOUR API KEY` for your actual access token, `don't add any " ou  '` other wise the token wont work.
Now please delete `.example`, and the file is ready.

### `npm start`
